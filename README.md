# CAS.AI Authorized Sellers for Apps (App-ads.txt)

[![Updated](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cleveradssolutions/App-ads.txt/master/Shield.json)](https://github.com/cleveradssolutions/App-ads.txt)

Authorized Sellers for Apps, also known as [app-ads.txt](https://iabtechlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/app-ads.txt-v1.0-final-.pdf), is an IAB initiative that helps protect your app ad inventory from ad fraud. You create app-ads.txt files to identify who is authorized to sell your inventory. Identifying authorized sellers can help you receive advertiser spend that might have otherwise gone toward counterfeit inventory of spoofed apps.

The app-ads.txt files are publicly available and crawlable by exchanges, supply-side platforms (SSP), other buyers, and third-party vendors.

A DSP looking to bid on app inventory scans the app-ads.txt file on a developer's website to verify which ad sources are authorized to sell that app's inventory. The DSP will only accept bid requests from ad sources listed on the file and authorized by the app developer.  

> **Warning**  
> If you don't implement app-ads.txt, it may hurt your eCPMs because there will be less advertisers willing to pay you for ads.

## Updating a Developer Website
It is important to pay attention to the instructions below before beginning the app-ads.txt implementation.
- You must list your **Developer Website URL** in the iTunes and GooglePlay app stores, as relevant.
- There must be a valid developer website URL in all app stores hosting your apps.
- This app-ads.txt guide only addresses Apple's App Store and Google Play stores, with both you can fully comply with the specs of app-ads.txt.
- The Developer Website URL is used by advertising platforms to locate the app-ads.txt file.  

### AppStore
<details>

Developer page is listed under **Developer Website**:

Follow these instructions to either update or add a developer website to the App Store page:

2. Select the app for which you want to add a new version.
3. Inside the app, click **+** for **Version or Platform**
4. In the new version add the **Marketing URL**
5. Post the `/app-ads.txt` file on the root folder of your developer website, listing all authorized sellers of their app inventory.

2. On the left menu bar click **Store Presence >> Store Listing**
3. Enter the details of your app

## Ensure your app-ads.txt files can be crawled
To ensure your app-ads.txt file can be crawled, we recommend working through the following troubleshooting steps.  

> **Note**  
> The following information was taken from a [Google Support resource](https://support.google.com/admob/answer/9679128).

### Confirm that the file is reachable from the root domain
Redirects from `domain.com/app-ads.txt` to `www.domain.com/app-ads.txt` are fairly common. App-ads.txt crawling will start at the root domain. The root domain needs to return from, or redirect to, the app-ads.txt file.  

> **Warning**  
> An app-ads.txt file on `www.domain.com/app-ads.txt` will only be crawled if `domain.com/app-ads.txt` redirects to it.

### Confirm the file is not temporarily unavailable
If a previously seen app-ads.txt file is unavailable on a subsequent re-crawl, the previously seen entries will be:
- Purged if the response is a hard 404 error (page that actually doesnâ€™t exist; HTTP 404 status).
- Retained for up to five days if the response is a soft 404 error (a real page returned for a URL that doesn't actually exist; HTTP 200 status) or a 500 server error.

### Ensure file is returned with an HTTP 200 OK status code
While a request for an app-ads.txt file may return the contents of the file in the response body, if the status code in the response header indicates the file was not found (e.g., status code 404):
- The response will be ignored.
- The file will be considered non-existent.  

Make sure the file has an HTTP 200 OK status code.

### Ensure there are no formatting errors or invalid characters in the file
Formatting errors, such as invalid whitespace characters, may be difficult to detect but can make an app-ads.txt file difficult to parse by a crawler, and may therefore result in a file being ignored. Avoid copying and pasting app-ads.txt entries from a rich text editor; we recommend a plain text editor. You can also check for invalid UTF-8 characters in your app-ads.txt file using a HEX editor.
